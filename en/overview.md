Elkarbacup provides easy to configure and powerful open source backup solution. It was developed to make the management of our backups easier, regardless of the operative system of the client machine operative system. It has been developed in order to make the management of our backups and restores easier.

ElkarBackup is a free open-source software and it's based in other open source technologies:

* [RSnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org)
* [RSync](https://rsync.samba.org)
* [PHP](http://php.net)
* [Symfony](http://www.symfony.com)

## Features

* Centralized backups
* Backup GNU\/Linux and Windows computers
* Easy-to-use and multilingual web interface
* Minimal disk usage \(only changes\) but having the option to recover the whole backup with a mouse click.
* Instant recovery

To achieve its magic, Elkarbackup stands on the shoulders of [RSnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org),  a fantastic command-line backup tool.

## How Elkabackup Benefits You

If you are a sysadmin who need a backup solution in order to save files from diferent machines, sometimes in your own network, but sometimes in external networks through VPN or ssh connections, sometimes with requirement of doing some actions before or after the backup \(i.e. your own checks, test etc.\),  Elkarbackup 





 will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you are used to working with \(editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.\). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration, so whether you are working on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way. Say goodbye to "works on my machine" bugs.

If you are an operations engineer, Vagrant gives you a disposable environment and consistent workflow for developing and testing infrastructure management scripts. You can quickly test things like shell scripts, Chef cookbooks, Puppet modules, and more using local virtualization such as VirtualBox or VMware. Then, with the same configuration, you can test these scripts on remote clouds such as AWS or RackSpace with the same workflow. Ditch your custom scripts to recycle EC2 instances, stop juggling SSH prompts to various machines, and start using Vagrant to bring sanity to your life.

If you are a designer, Vagrant will automatically set everything up that is required for that web app in order for you to focus on doing what you do best: design. Once a developer configures Vagrant, you do not need to worry about how to get that app running ever again. No more bothering other developers to help you fix your environment so you can test designs. Just check out the code, vagrant up, and start designing.
