Elkarbackup provides easy to configure and powerful open source backup solution. It was developed to make the management of our backups easier, regardless of the operating system of the client machine.

ElkarBackup is a free open-source software and it's based on other open source technologies:

* [RSnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org)
* [RSync](https://rsync.samba.org)
* [PHP](http://php.net)
* [Symfony](http://www.symfony.com)

## Features

* Centralized backups to disk devices.
* Backup GNU\/Linux and Windows computers.
* Easy-to-use and multilingual web interface.
* Minimal disk usage, but having the option to recover the whole backup with a mouse click.
* Instant recovery

To achieve its magic, Elkarbackup stands on the shoulders of [RSnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org),  a fantastic command-line backup tool.

## How Elkabackup Benefits You

If you are a sysadmin who need a backup solution in order to save files from different machines, sometimes in your own network, but sometimes in external networks through VPN or ssh connections, sometimes with requirement of doing some actions before or after the backup \(i.e. your own checks, test etc.\),  Elkarbackup is your solution.

As you can read on [RSnapshot's web site](http://rsnapshot.org), _"rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync. rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines, and remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard links whenever possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required."_

Elkarbackup offers you an abstraction layer that helps you to use the power of rsnapshot through a web interface, so you don't need to work with the console in order to manage your backups. What is more, once you have set up your backup configuration, you can delegate the backup system management to other people who don't match the sysadmin role.
