In the next pages we will speak about  _clients_ and _tasks_ :

* **Client**: A client is a host that contains the data we want to save. It could be any machine that supports ssh or rsync automated connectivity. In this manual we'll focus on GNU\/Linux and Windows clients.

* **Task**: Each root folder we want to save from each client. Each task has it's own configuration with it's own frecuency and retention policy. A client could have \(and usually it has\) more than one task.
