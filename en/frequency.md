You have to define how often you have to make the copies, and these are the options:

* During the day \(Hourly\): We define the copies that the system will make at different times of the day. The system names them as Hourly.0, Hourly.1, Hourly.2 .....
* Daily \(Daily\): We will define the copies that the system will make each day of the week, specifying on which specific days and at what time it will do them. The system names them as Daily.0, Daily.1, Daily.2 .....
* Weekly: We will define the copies that the system will make once a week, specifying on which day of the week \(only one\) and at what time it will do them. The system names them as Weekly.0, Weekly.1, Weekly.2 .....
* Monthly: We will define the copies that the system will make once a month, specifying the day of the month and the time. The system names them as Monthly.0, Monthly.1, Monthly.2 .....

When I say that _**"the system will make"**_, I am not telling the whole truth. Sometimes it will make the copies and others it will rotate the copies previously made. We will see this shortly when explaining the rotation.
