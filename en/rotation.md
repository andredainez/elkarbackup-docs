This is not complicated, but you have to understand it well. In defining frequency, we are also setting different levels of copy, specifying in some way that Weekly precedes Monthly, Daily precedes Weekly, and Hourly precedes Daily. There is no level that precedes Hourly.

We can have different copy policies, but for the example imagine that our programming is composed as follows:

* Hourly copies at 11:00, 14:00 and 16:00, with a retention of 3
* Daily copies from Monday through Friday at 9:00 PM, with a retention of 10
* Weekly copies on Saturdays at 9pm, with a retention of 5
* Monthly copies on the 1st of each month at 9:00 PM, with a retention of 24

In this case the copies are made as follows:

* When the hour arrives to execute the _**Hourly**_ copy first of all it deletes the last one \(_**Hourly.2**_\), and next it changes the name of the rest of folders. _**Hourly.1 → Hourly.2**_ and _**Hourly.0 → Hourly.1**_. Then it makes the new copy in the _**Hourly.0**_ folder.
* When the hour arrives to execute the _**Daily**_ copy first of all it deletes the last one \(_**Daily.9**_\), and next it changes the name of the rest of folders. _**Daily.8 → Daily.9,**_ _**Daily.7 → Daily.8, ..., Daily.0 → Daily.1 **_. The difference comes now, in this case the system _**will not make a new copy to create the Daily.0**_, it will be generated by _**a rotation of the last copy of the previous level: Hourly.2 → Daily.0**_
* When the hour arrives to execute the _**Weekly**_ copy first of all it deletes the last one \(_**Weekly.4**_\), and next it changes the name of the rest of folders. _**Weekly.3 → Weekly.4,**_ _**Weekly.2 → Weekly.3, ..., Weekly.0 → Weekly.1 **_. _**Neither in this case will a new copy be made**_ to create the Weekly.0, it will be generated by a rotation of the last copy of the previous level: _**Daily.9 → Weekly.0**_
* When the hour arrives to execute the _**Monthly**_ copy first of all it deletes the last one \(_**Monthly.23**_\), and next it changes the name of the rest of folders. _**Monthly.22 → Monthly.23,**_ _**Monthly.21 → Monthly.22, ..., Monthly.0 → Monthly.1 **_. _**Neither in this case will a new copy be made**_ to create the Monthly.0, it will be generated by a rotation of the last copy of the previous level: _**Weekly.9 → Monthly.0**_

Here's what to understand: _**The rotation will only move the last copy of the previous level**_, it will never move any other folder.

That is to say:

* If the Hourly retention is 3, Daily rotation will only move the Hourly.2, never the rest.
* If the Hourly retention is 2, the Daily rotation will only move the Hourly.1, never the Hourly.0

In this logic there is a condition that we must have clear; Never touching the folders that end in .0, and for this reason _**the retention can not be 1 when in policies there are higher levels**_, the Daily will never touch the Hourly.0, and the Weekly will not touch the Daily.0 either.

It is important to understand this, since it is the logic that will be used below when we define the policies from the web interface.
