In our example, we want to backup the "\/var\/www" folder from a GNU\/Linux client that has the 192.168.1.12 IP address.

## Add the client

In order to add a new client, we have to click on the **_Add Client_** button, and we will face a self-documented form where we will enter the client data.

In our example,

* Name: _My Linux Client_

* URL: root@192.168.1.12


Once we have enter this data, we will click on the **_Save_** button and we will see the new client in the main page, but we have not any job yet.
