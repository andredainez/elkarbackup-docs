Let's imagine that in a policy we have a retention of 6 for Hourly, this means that we will have the folders Hourly.0, ..., Houry.5 with the data of the last copies. For some reason we think it is excessive, and we modify the retention to 4, therefore it will use the folders Hourly.0, ..., Houry.3.

And what about the Hourly.4 and Houry.5 folders? Well, they'll be there until we delete them. They will not be updated and will be outdated because they will not enter in the rotation cycle, but they will be there, "making noise". The best option in these cases is to delete those folders by hand.
