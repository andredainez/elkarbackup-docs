With retention we are going to specify how many folders will have to save the system of each frequency. For example:

* If we put a retention of 4 on copies made during the day \(Hourly\), that means that the system will keep the last 4 copies in the folders Hourly.0, Hourly.1, Hourly.2 and Hourly.3, where Hourly.0 will be the newest and Hourly.3 the oldest.
* If we put a retention of 5 on the copies made once a day \(Daily\), that means the system will keep the last 5 copies in the Daily.0, Daily.1, Daily.2, Daily.3 and Daily.4 folders, where Daily.0 will be the newest and Daily.4 the oldest.
* The same logic applies to the retentions applied to Weekly and Monthly copies.
